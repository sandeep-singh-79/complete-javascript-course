      // HOW THE ASYNC WORKS IN JAVASCRIPT:
      // a new execution context is created for method first. This is followed by the
      // execution context for the console statement. When this returns, a new
      // context is created for the setTimeout function. This creates a context
      // in the web API stack which keeps on running till the end of the timer.
      // In the meanwhile, the setTimeout context returns and is removed from the
      // call stack. Next, a new context is created for the next console statement
      // It is removed once it completes execution.
      // In the meanwhile, the timer runs out and the callback is added to the MQ
      // This is where the event loop comes into the picture. The event loop monitors
      // both the MQ and the call stack. The event loop moves the first item in the MQ
      // to the call stack as soon as the call stack becomes empty.
      // A new execution context is created for the callback and, the callback executed.
      // This will continue till all items in the MQ have been moved to the call stack.
